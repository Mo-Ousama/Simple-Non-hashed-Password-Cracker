# Simple-Non-hashed-Password-Cracker
This is a tool that I chose to develop as my Principles of Computer Security final project - It is designed to convey the risks of not hashing and allowing users to create weak passwords by showing that passwords can be modeled.
ðŸ“Œ Description

A simple yet powerful password-cracking tool that utilizes dictionary attacks and brute-force techniques to crack non-hashed or weakly encrypted passwords. The tool supports MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashing algorithms and allows users to input a password for testing. If a dictionary attack fails, it can optionally switch to a brute-force approach for deeper password analysis.
ðŸš€ Features
